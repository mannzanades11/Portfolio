<p class="text">The beauty of a woman must be seen from in her eyes, because that is the doorway to her heart, the place where love resides.
<p class="text">We're born alone, we live alone, we die alone. Only through our love and friendship can we create the illusion for the moment that we're not alone.
<p class="text">Beauty is when you can appreciate yourself. When you love yourself, that's when you're most beautiful.
<p class="text">I'm having fun. I'm being myself. I'm doing what I love. That's all that matters.
<p class="text">Love is friendship that has caught fire. It is quiet understanding, mutual confidence, sharing and forgiving. It is loyalty through good and bad times. It settles for less than perfection and makes allowances for human weaknesses.
