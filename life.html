<p class="text">Only I can change my life. No one can do it for me.
<p class="text">Peace is the beauty of life. It is sunshine. It is the smile of a child, the love of a mother, the joy of a father, the togetherness of a family. It is the advancement of man, the victory of a just cause, the triumph of truth.
<p class="text">Life is short, and if we enjoy every moment of every day, then we will be happy no matter what happens or what changes along the way.
<p class="text">Beginning today, treat everyone you meet as if they were going to be dead by midnight. Extend to them all the care, kindness and understanding you can muster, and do it with no thought of any reward. Your life will never be the same again.
<p class="text">Life ain't always beautiful, but it's a beautiful ride.
