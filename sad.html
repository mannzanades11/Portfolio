<p class="text">Some days are just bad days, that's all. You have to experience sadness to know happiness, and I remind myself that not every day is going to be a good day, that's just the way it is!
<p class="text">It's time to say goodbye, but I think goodbyes are sad and I'd much rather say hello. Hello to a new adventure.
<p class="text">It's okay to be sad if things don't go the way you had hoped.
<p class="text">I'm not a sad person, upset the whole time, but I seem to be quite emotional.
<p class="text">We can feel sad, hurt, demoralized. But we can't give up.
