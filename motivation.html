<p class="text">Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it.
<p class="text">Change your life today. Don't gamble on the future, act now, without delay.Believe in yourself! Have faith in your abilities! Without a humble but reasonable confidence in your own powers you cannot be successful or happy.
<p class="text">With the new day comes new strength and new thoughts.Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time.
<p class="text">We should not give up and we should not allow the problem to defeat us.
<p class="text">Do the difficult things while they are easy and do the great things while they are small. A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step.
